# Music-Therapy-on-Mental-Health
This project shows the effect of music therapy on individuals with different mental health conditions
Project Overview:

This project aims to explore the relationship between music consumption and mental health, focusing on how different music genres, listening habits, and streaming platform preferences influence individuals' emotional well-being. The primary objective is to analyze survey data from a diverse group of participants, examining their age, preferred music genres, daily listening hours, and mental health conditions, specifically anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

The survey seeks to answer critical questions, including how music impacts mental health, which music genres are most effective in improving well-being, and the role of music in managing mental health conditions. By identifying patterns and correlations, the project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations for using music as a tool for emotional and psychological well-being.

Key aspects of the study include understanding the age distribution of participants, analyzing the frequency and duration of music listening, and evaluating the mental health challenges that respondents face. The findings are expected to help refine approaches to music therapy and offer practical advice on incorporating music into daily routines for better mental health outcomes.

Data Overview:

The analysis of the survey data concentrated on the following key variables:

Age: The age of individuals who participated in the survey.
Primary Streaming Platform: The streaming platform that each participant uses most frequently.
Listening Hours: The number of hours each individual spends listening to music daily.
Favorite Genre: The music genre that each participant enjoys the most.
Listening to Music While Working: A binary response—Yes or No—indicating whether participants listen to music while working.
Mental Health Conditions: Participants were asked to rate the severity of various mental health conditions on a scale from 1 to 10. These conditions included anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Music's Effect on Mental Health: Participants were asked how music affects their mental health, with options such as No Effect, Improvement, or Worsening.
Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project were as follows:

Age Distribution: To analyze the age range of participants and determine if the survey covers a diverse demographic, including teenagers and adults.
Genre and Streaming Platform Preferences: To identify the music genres and streaming platforms that are most popular among the respondents.
Mental Health Conditions: To examine the prevalence and severity of mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD) among participants and identify the most prominent disorder.
Music Listening Habits: To explore the average number of hours spent listening to music and to assess the role of music in improving mental health.
Key Performance Indicators:

Survey Participation: A total of 736 people participated in the survey.
Age Range: The majority of respondents (over 50%) were between the ages of 18 and 30.
Listening Habits: More than half of the respondents reported spending 2 to 6 hours per day listening to music.
Mental Health Findings: Anxiety was identified as the most common mental health disorder among participants.
Music Genre Preferences: The most popular music genres were Rock, Pop, and Metal.
Observations:

The survey revealed the following key insights regarding the relationship between music and mental health:

Music's Impact on Mental Health: A significant majority of respondents (74.45%) reported that music positively impacted their mental state, while 23.21% stated that music had no effect. Only 2.34% indicated that listening to music made their mental state worse. This suggests that music plays a crucial role in improving mental well-being for most individuals.
Mental Health Condition Severity:
OCD: OCD was found to be the least prevalent disorder among respondents.
Insomnia: Insomnia symptoms showed a slight decrease in severity across all age groups as intensity increased.
Depression: The survey revealed an increasing trend in depression severity between scales 6 and 8. However, participants over the age of 50 reported lower levels of depression compared to younger age groups.
Anxiety: Anxiety emerged as the most prominent condition, with respondents across all age groups experiencing moderate to severe levels of anxiety (scales 6–10). Anxiety was reported more frequently and intensely than any other disorder.
Age Group Analysis: Anxiety was consistently the most reported and severe condition across all age groups. However, as age increased, the prevalence of depression decreased, with older participants (50+) reporting lower depression scores. OCD was notably rare, and insomnia was less impactful as age increased.
Music's Role in Mental Health: There is a clear correlation between music listening habits and improvements in mental health, particularly in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The findings suggest that incorporating music into daily routines can significantly help in managing mental health conditions.
Recommendations:

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

Music Therapy: Music therapy is a well-established practice that uses music to address various aspects of physical, emotional, and social health. For individuals experiencing anxiety or depression, learning to play an instrument or singing can be effective ways to reduce stress. Playing an instrument helps foster a connection to sound, while singing can improve concentration, emotional expression, and lung function.
Seeking Professional Guidance: For those who report worsening mental states after listening to music, it is advisable to seek professional assistance. A qualified music therapist or mental health professional can provide tailored guidance and support in addressing underlying mental health issues.
Incorporating Music into Daily Routines: For optimal mental health benefits, individuals should consider incorporating music into their daily routines. Experimenting with various music genres, artists, and listening environments can help identify the music that works best for each individual, contributing to improved emotional and psychological well-being.
